#INTRODUCTION TO DIRECTORY
README: Introduction to this directory and Introduction to how to compiler the program to get the result 		automatically or by hand.

src: This directory includes 5 files:
	C0.lex: The first draft of word formation of C0.
	makefile: Some rules for compiler the pl0.
	pl0.c: pl0.c file
	pl0.h: pl0.h file
	pl0.lex: pl0.lex file which is used to produce the lex.yy.c through using flex.

doc: The design of the pl0 and word fomation of pl0 and C0.

bin: shell for compiling and running pl0 program more quickly.

test: Some programs written by language pl0 for testing the pl0 compiler.


#BUILD RUN CLEAN PL0 COMPILER

There are two ways you can compile the program through makefile.
$ cd src

(Build pl0 compiler)

$ make: you can get a pl0 which part of program is made by flex.

or

$ make pl0: you can get a pl0 which is totally man_made.

(Clean pl0 compiler)

$ make clean: clean all the programs which are produced through these two process.

(Run pl0 compiler)

$ bin/pl0 ../test/"filename"

or

$ cd bin
  ./pl0 ../../test/"filename"
